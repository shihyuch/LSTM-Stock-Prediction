# LSTM-Stock-Prediction

Deep learning is involved a lot in the trend prediction field. There are many different neural networks can be applied to stock price prediction problems. The Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) network 
outperforms others architecture since it can take advantage of predicting time series (or sequentially) with a specific configuration.
